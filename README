This project enables the integration of Python with constraint engines.

This integration will be implemented in stages.  The first stage will be a simple, and primitive integration.  It will be something along these lines:

|Python - main    |listener    |Picat,other
|----add listener(listener)--->|
|----run goal----------------->|
|		  |<-unify-----|
|                 |  ...       |
|<-----------------------------|

Subsequent iterations will consider increasingly tighter integration of the two languages

More specifics will be available soon
